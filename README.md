dashboard
=========

Experiments in dashboard design using rstudio and shiny. 'Dashboard' is based on a 'cafe' senario and in its initial implementation will show a number of static graphs and tables showing takings / expenses etc. In the future interactive features will be added. 

Need to - tidy up 'server.R' (bits of redundant code !!).
